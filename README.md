Line View is a simple Augmented Reality application that allows you place two ‘Andy’ Android characters in your phone’s view finder, and draw a line between them.

It is built on ARCore and Sceneform, extending the simple HelloSceneForm example app.

Each ‘Andy’ can be moved left, right, up, down, forwards and backwards independently and a line can be added between them whenever the Andy’s are moved to a new position.

As this is an Augmented reality application, using Android’s ARCore and the Sceneform framework, the Andy’s are anchored in place and will stay in the same spot as you move your phone around them.

This application will allow you get a feel for the capabilities of your device and of the AR frameworks, understanding in particular, how depth and occlusion may impact how you apply and use AR in applications.

The app can either be built and installed from the repository here by importing it into Android Studio, or you can test it on your device directly from the Play store at the link here:
